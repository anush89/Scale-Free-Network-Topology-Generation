Scale-Free-Network-Topology-Generation
======================================

Designed and implemented the Barabasi-Albert model for generating scale free networks. A variation of Distance Vector protocol was used to maintain information of the nodes in the network. A test for scalability of the algorithm was performed using 100 nodes in our college network.
